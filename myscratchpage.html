        <h2>The "Hick from French Lick"</h2>
        <p>Larry Bird is considered one of the greatest basketball players of 
            all time because of his elite shooting, clutch performances, and instinctual
            passing. Larry grew up in French Lick, Indiana where he developed a love of
            basketball playing with other African Americans in the town. He truly broke barriers
            in doing so and was differen for his time.</p>
        <p>Larry Bird entered the NBA at age 23 and was drafted from Indiana State to play for the
            Boston Centics. Bird excelled there and helped the team make the playoffs in a few seaosns.
            In 1981, Bird won his first championship with the Celtics and went on to play against the Los
            Angeles Lakers in the ensuing years, beating them in NBA Finals in 1984 and 1986
        </p>
        <p>Larry was a talented shooter and often called his shots before they went in. He was also a big trash talker
            often beating down on opponents physcially and mentally. He always seemed to be one step ahead of the
            defense and knew exactly where he needed to be to hit the game winning shot, make the game winning passing,
            or steal the ball to save a game.
